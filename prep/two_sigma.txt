latency is the amount of time to finish an operation throughput is the amount of work we finished in a unit time


Definition of terms

Let us attempt to define those two terms:

Latency is the time required to perform some action or to produce some result. Latency is measured in units of time -- hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds or clock periods.

Throughput is the number of such actions executed or results produced per unit of time. This is measured in units of whatever is being produced (cars, motorcycles, I/O samples, memory words, iterations) per unit of time. The term "memory bandwidth" is sometimes used to specify the throughput of memory systems.

A simple example

The following manufacturing example should clarify these two concepts:

An assembly line is manufacturing cars. It takes eight hours to manufacture a car and that the factory produces one hundred and twenty cars per day.

The latency is: 8 hours.

The throughput is: 120 cars / day or 5 cars / hour.
