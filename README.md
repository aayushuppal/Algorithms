# Algorithms
<h1>Implementation of several problems and algorithm concepts.</h1>

*The Readme is a work in progress, majority file entries at the point are missing from the Readme but the directories and classifications are mostly clear for navigation and search.*

**/src/LocalMaxMin.java**
Find local maximum and minimum in an array O(n) Time & O(1) space eg: 2,2,3,4,5,-1,3,3,2,5 will have a total of 6 spikes(both min and max).

**/src/OneZeroMultiple.c**
Find One Zero multiple of a number.

**/src/OneZeroMultiple.java**
Find One Zero multiple of a number. Incomplete implementation.

**/src/PrimeFactors/SuperPower.java**
Check if a  number is a super power, done by finding prime factors of a number and assessing the conditions on it.
 
**/src/Palindromes/OptimalPalindromeCalc.java**
Using the concept of Manacher fastest method to find all palindrome strings and substrings in a string. Returns number of possible palindromes in a string.

**/src/Palindromes/Manacher.java**
Manacher algorithm java implementation (Sedgwick) file.

**/src/Palindromes/MostValPalin.java**
Given a string, S, find the value, V, of the MostValuable Palindrome formed by a substring of S.

**/src/Palindromes/MostValPalin2.java**
Given a string, S, find the value, V, of the MostValuable Palindrome formed by a substring of S.

**/src/Cormen/AnimalFarm.java**
ordering and usage of animals on a farm using super constructor and instanceof.

**/src/SeparatePackage**
Testing a directed graph as a separate package.

**/src/pastAmaz/versionNumCompare.java**
using string split regex, ternary operator for a version number comparison. different cases to be handled for unequal strings of version numbers.
handled cases "12.21.0001"; //"12.21.3456"; "12.21.3456"; VS "12.21.001"; //"12.21.3457"; "12.21".

**/src/RegEx/regexTest.java**
This code block checks a pattern and splits a string around it, including the end of string in it's pattern too. Also returns count of regex / the pattern itself replaces the pattern as well.

**/src/String/substringCheck.java**
begin index - denotes the the first index that is included, end index - the index next to the last one to be included.

**/src/pastAmaz/Fibonacci.java**
Iterative and recursive implementation of Fibonacci series.

**/src/pastAmaz/ClockAngle.java**
Angle between hour and minute hand of a clock.

**/src/Linked_List/MyLinkedList.java**
My linked list implementation.

**/src/Linked_List/MergePointLinkList.java**
Approach 1 - store address of nodes in a hashset and then compare O(m+n) space and time.
Approach 2 - offset from start approach.
Approach 3 - by finding head of circular linked list approach.

**/src/String/MyStringBuffer.java**
implementation of StringBuffer - append and retString methods.

**/src/String/RemoveWhitespaces.java**
Remove whitespaces using string builder, no regex.

**/src/Linked_List/DoublyLinkedList.java**
Doubly linked list implementation.

**/src/Sorting/InsertionSort.java**
Insertion sort implementation.
