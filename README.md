# Algorithms
<h1>Implementation of several problems and algorithm concepts.</h1>

*The Readme is a work in progress, majority file entries at the point are missing from the Readme but the directories and classifications are mostly clear for navigation and search.*

**/LocalMaxMin.java**
Find local maximum and minimum in an array O(n) Time & O(1) space eg: 2,2,3,4,5,-1,3,3,2,5 will have a total of 6 spikes(both min and max).

**/OneZeroMultiple.c**
Find One Zero multiple of a number.

**/OneZeroMultiple.java**
Find One Zero multiple of a number. Incomplete implementation.

**/PrimeFactors/SuperPower.java**
Check if a  number is a super power, done by finding prime factors of a number and assessing the conditions on it.
 
**/Palindromes/Optimized/PalindromeCalc.java**
Using the concept of Manacher fastest method to find all palindrome strings and substrings in a string. Returns number of possible palindromes in a string.

**/Palindromes/Manacher.java**
Manacher algorithm java implementation (Sedgwick) file.

**/Palindromes/MostValPalin.java**
Given a string, S, find the value, V, of the MostValuable Palindrome formed by a substring of S.

**/Palindromes/MostValPalin2.java**
Given a string, S, find the value, V, of the MostValuable Palindrome formed by a substring of S.

**/Cormen/AnimalFarm.java**
ordering and usage of animals on a farm using super constructor and instanceof.

**/SeparatePackage**
